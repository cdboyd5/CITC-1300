                <h1>welcome to Animals Being Bros</h1>
                
                <p> This is a Page dedicated to animals being friendly to people or other animals (honestly its just a place where i post cute stuff). This is the about page.</p>
                <p> I do not have context for most of these pictures or videos, so I will usually provide a (sometimes) funny caption.</p>
                <p> While it may show some videos as being muted when you first load the page there is only one that is intentionally muted because I have it playing on a loop and it would get annoying, the others don't have sound.</p>
                <h4>legal stuff</h4>
                <P> I own none of the images or videos on this site. they were found on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsBeingBros/" target="_blank"> Reddit</a>.</P>
