                <h1>welcome to Animals Being Bros</h1>
                
                <p> This is a Page dedicated to animals being friendly to people or other animals (honestly its just a place where i post cute stuff). This is the images page.</p>
                <p>I do not have context for most of these pictures, so I will usually provide a (sometimes) funny caption.</p>
                
                <h2>its always good to have a wing woman</h2>
                <p>I have some context on this image. Aparently this stork (called Yaren) always visits her friend Adam after her migration, and as of 4 days ago (at the time of writing this) this is their 10th year
                    of their friendship.
